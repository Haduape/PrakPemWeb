            A lonely and socially anxious first-year student. She is self-described&nbsp;&nbsp;as an &#34;in-kya&#34;,
            i.e., a gloomy, indoor-dwelling outcast. She longs to&nbsp;&nbsp;join a band and become popular, and so
            starts playing the guitar. <br /><br />
            She becomes the lead guitarist of Kessoku Band. Her skill is phenomenal, but she can&#39;t show it well in a
            band or in public. She always begins&nbsp;&nbsp;her sentences with &#34;Ah&#34;.

          <p class="a-bright-and-popular">
            A bright and popular first year of high school. She is in charge of the&nbsp;&nbsp;guitar and vocals of
            Kessoku Band. She is a cheerful character who likes to interact with people and can talk with an immediate
            smile, even when meeting for the first time. She longs for Ryo, and her feelings can go&nbsp;&nbsp;too far.
            She often takes photos and uploads to Issta.

          A cool and solitary second year of high school. She is in charge of the&nbsp;&nbsp;bass of Kessoku Band.
          She&#39;s the best friend of Nijika. Her hobbies are&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the ordinary, and she rejoices when
          called a weirdo. She lives&nbsp;&nbsp;with a wealthy family, but she spends much of her money on
          instruments&nbsp;&nbsp;and always runs out of money. She occasionally eats weeds to get rid of&nbsp;&nbsp;her
          hunger.
